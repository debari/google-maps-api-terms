        Google Maps API for Business - APAC Purchase Agreement
      
This agreement for the purchase of Google Maps API for Business (the
      "Agreement") is made and entered into by and between Google Asia Pacific Pte. Ltd.
      (Co. Reg. No. 200817984R) ("Google") and the customer identified on the Ordering
      Document ("Customer"). This Agreement and the corresponding Ordering Document governs
      Customer's access to and use of the Services.
      1. Licenses.
        1.1 From Google to Customer. Subject to this Agreement, and in consideration of
        Customer's payment of Fees, Google grants to Customer, and Customer agrees to comply with a
        non-sublicensable, non-transferable, non-exclusive, terminable, limited license in the
        Territory to: (a) use the Services to display the Content and Track Assets solely in the
        Customer Implementation; and (b) access, use, publicly perform and publicly display the
        Content in the Customer Implementation.
        1.2 From Customer to Google. When Customer submits queries
        via the Services that include Customer Content, Google requires a license to that Customer
        Content so it can process the query and return results to Customer. Therefore, by
        submitting Customer Content to Google through the Services, Customer grants to Google a
        non-sublicensable, non-transferable, non-exclusive, terminable, limited license to
        reproduce, adapt, modify, publish, communicate, translate, and distribute this Customer
        Content to Customer solely to enable Google to provide and improve the Services.
      
2. Customer Content. If a data storage API is purchased,
      Customer may upload and store Customer Content as part of the Services via the methods
      described in the Documentation. Customer Content will not be returned to Customer, whether
      the Customer Content is physically shipped to Google, or entered by Customer or Google.
      Customer is solely responsible for backing up its Customer Content. Google will not bear any
      risk of loss for Customer Content.
      3. Modifications.
        3.1 To the Services. Subject to Section 8.2 (Deprecation), Google may make
        commercially reasonable changes to the Services from time to time. If Google makes a
        material change to the Services, Google will inform Customer, provided that Customer has
        subscribed with Google to be informed about these changes.
        3.2 To URL Terms. Google may make commercially reasonable
        changes to the URL Terms from time to time. If Google makes a material change to the URL
        Terms, Google will inform Customer, provided that Customer has subscribed with Google to be
        informed about these changes. If the change has a material adverse impact on Customer and
        Customer does not agree to the change, Customer must notify Google within thirty days after
        receiving notice of these changes. If Customer notifies Google as required, then Customer
        will remain governed by the terms in effect immediately prior to the change until the end
        of the then-current License Term. If the License Term is renewed, it will do so under the
        updated URL Terms.
      
4. Restrictions.
4.1 License Restrictions. Unless Google specifically agrees
        in writing or through the Documentation, Customer will not
        
          a. hide or mask from Google the identity of Customer Implementation, including by failing
          to follow the identification conventions listed in the Documentation;
          
            b. use, distribute, or sell any Content outside of the Customer Implementation or
            incorporate or embed the Services into any of Customer's products that it sells to
            third parties;
          
            c. attempt to reverse engineer the Services or any component or attempt to create a
            substitute or similar service thorough use of or access to the Services;
          
            d. modify, reorder, augment or manipulate search results in any way unless Customer
            indicate to the End User that this has occurred;
          
            e. use the Services for High Risk Activities;
          
            f. create or offer a âwrapperâ for the Services, unless Customer obtain Googleâs
            written consent to do so. For example, Customer are not permitted to: (a) use or
            provide any part of the Service or Content in an API that Customer offer to others; or
            (b) create a Customer Implementation that re-implements or duplicates the Services.
            Customer is not âwrappingâ the Services if the Customer Implementation provides
            substantial additional features or content beyond the Services, and those additional
            features or content constitute the primary defining characteristic of the Customer
            Implementation;
          
            g. use the Services or Content with any products, systems, or applications for or in
            connection with any of the following: (i) real time navigation or route guidance,
            including but not limited to turn-by-turn route guidance that is synchronized to the
            position of a user's sensor-enabled device; or (ii) any systems or functions for
            automatic or autonomous control of vehicle behavior;
          
            h. display business listings Content in any Customer Implementation that has the
            primary purpose of making available business, residential address, or telephone
            directory listings;
          
            i. print more than five thousand copies of sales collateral materials containing a
            screenshot of the Content for purposes of commercial sales lead generation or
            incorporate the Content as a core part of printed matter (such as printed maps or guide
            books) that is redistributed for a fee;
          
            j. use the Service in a manner that gives access to mass downloads or bulk feeds of any
            Content;
          
            k. use the Services outside the Licensed Configuration specified in the applicable
            Ordering Document or usage limits specified in the Documentation; or
          
            l. use content derived from the Service without a corresponding Google Map (ex.
            Geocodes obtained through the Service may not be used except with a Google Map).
          
            m. with respect to APIs that identify specific End User location information (âEUL
            APIsâ), and any contradictory Agreement terms notwithstanding, Customer will not obtain
            or cache an End Userâs location without the End Userâs prior consent. Customer will
            notify End User in advance of the End-User data Customer intends to collect and if
            Customer intends to use EUL APIs with any other data providerâs data. End Userâs
            consent to data collection under this section must be revocable at any time. Customer
            further agrees not to provide any personally identifiable information or device
            identifiers along with any Customer Content.
          
4.2 Customer IDs. Customer IDs are required, must be used
        according to the Documentation, and will be forwarded to Customer electronically. Google
        may not respond to requests with an invalid Customer ID. Customer's failure to use a
        Customer ID provided by Google will prevent access to the Services and nullify Googleâs
        obligations under this Agreement.
        4.3 Third Party Components. Any third party component
        embedded, included or provided by Google for use with the Services may only be used in
        conjunction with the Services, and this use is subject to this Agreement and the
        Documentation. However, to the extent Services include components governed by open source
        licenses with provisions inconsistent with this Agreement, those components are instead
        governed solely by the applicable open source licenses. To the extent Services include
        components covered by open source licenses requiring the provision of corresponding source
        code for those components, Google hereby offers the provision of that source code
        consistent with those licenses.
        4.4 Cache Restrictions. Customer may not pre-fetch, retrieve,
        cache, index, or store any Content, or portion of the Services with the exception being
        Customer may store limited amounts of Content solely to improve the performance of the
        Customer Implementation due to network latency, and only if Customer does so temporarily,
        securely, and in a manner that (a) does not permit use of the Content outside of the
        Services; (b) does not manipulate or aggregate any Content or portion of the Services; (c)
        does not prevent Google from accurately tracking usage; and (e) does not modify attribution
        in any way.
        4.5 Development Kits. Development kits may only be used for
        development or educational purposes, or both and are not permitted for use in a production
        environment. TSS is included with development kits.
      
5. Customer Obligations.
5.1 Advertising. Customer can configure the Services to
        display Ads, or not, to End Users in its sole discretion. Customer can enable Ads in the
        Customer Implementation by following the instructions in the Documentation.
        5.2 Domain. The Customer must own the Domains listed on the
        Order Form. Additional domains may be added with the prior written approval of Google,
        which may be via email. Prior to providing the Services, Google may verify that Customer
        owns or controls the Domains. If Customer does not own or control the Domains, then Google
        will have no obligation to provide the Services to Customer.
        5.3 Maps Terms, Privacy, Legal Notices and AUP.
a. Compliance. Customer agrees to comply with the Maps
          Terms, the Legal Notices, and the AUP. Customer is responsible for its End Usersâ
          compliance with the Maps Terms, the Legal Notices, and the AUP.
          b. Privacy Policy. By using the Service, Customer agrees
          that Google may use Customer Content in accordance with its Privacy Policy. Additionally,
          Customer will protect the privacy rights of its End Users and will obtain and maintain
          all required consents from End Users to allow: (i) Customer's access, monitoring, use or
          disclosure of any data submitted thorough the Customer Implementation and Google
          providing Customer with the ability to do so (for example, Customer may not store an End
          Userâs location without consent); and (ii) Google to provide the Services to Customer.
        
6. Ownership and Publicity.
6.1 Generally. Except as expressly set forth herein, this
        Agreement does not grant either party any rights, implied or otherwise, to the other's
        content or any of the other's Intellectual Property Rights. Intellectual Property Rights in
        and to the content accessed through the Services are the property of the applicable content
        owner and may be protected by applicable laws.
        6.2 Brand Features. If Customer wants to display Google Brand
        Features in connection with its use of the Services, Customer will comply with the
        Trademark Guidelines. Customer will not alter any images generated by the Services to
        remove any Brand Feature or proprietary notice of Google or its licensors. Any use of a
        party's Brand Features will inure to the benefit of the party holding rights in those Brand
        Features. Each party agrees not to: (a) challenge or assist others to challenge the other
        party's Brand Features or registration thereof (except to protect such party's rights with
        respect to its own Brand Features) attempt to register any Brand Features that are
        confusingly similar to those of the other party.
        6.3 Publicity. Customer agrees that Google may include
        Customerâs name or Brand Features in a list of Google customers, whether online or in
        offline promotional materials. Customer also agrees that Google may verbally reference
        Customer as a customer of the Google Services. This section is subject to the âBrand
        Features Limitationâ section of the Agreement.
      
7. Export Compliance. Customer will comply with and will obtain
      all required authorization from applicable government authorities under the Export Control
      Laws. This Section 7 will survive termination or cancellation of this Agreement.
      8. Support.
8.1 TSS. Google will provide TSS to Customer in accordance
        with the TSSG for the License Term. Unless otherwise agreed in writing, to receive TSS
        Customer must provide Google with reasonably required access to the Services in accordance
        with the TSSG. Customer's failure to provide this access will be at Customer's own risk and
        without liability to Google. If the Ordering Document does not identify a support level,
        then Google will provide Standard Support. Google may change the TSS from time to time, but
        not if the changes materially adversely impact Customer.
        
          8.2 Deprecation. Googleâs Services deprecation terms are available at
          http://www.google.com/work/earthmaps/legal/us/deprecation.html.
        
9. Payment.
9.1 Purchase Process. Google will provide Customer an
        Ordering Document for each purchase, to confirm the Services, quantity and Fees.
        9.2 Payment. All Fees are due thirty days from the invoice
        date. All payments due are in the currency and mode of payment indicated on the invoice.
        9.3 Taxes.
a. Defined. âTaxesâ means any duties, customs fees, or
          taxes (other than Googleâs income tax) associated with the sale of the Services,
          including any related penalties or interest.
          b. Customerâs Responsibility. Customer is responsible for
          any Taxes, and Customer will pay Google for the Services without any reduction for such
          amounts. If Google is obligated to collect or pay Taxes, the Taxes will be invoiced to
          Customer, unless Customer provides Google with a valid tax exemption certificate
          authorized by the appropriate taxing authority. If Customer is required by law to
          withhold any Taxes from its payments to Google, Customer must provide Google with an
          official tax receipt or other appropriate documentation to support this withholding.
        
9.4 Invoice Disputes. Any invoice disputes must be submitted
        prior to the invoice due date. If the parties determine that certain billing inaccuracies
        are attributable to Google, Google will not issue a corrected invoice, but will instead
        issue a credit memo specifying the incorrect amount in the affected invoice. If the
        disputed invoice has not yet been paid, Google will apply the credit memo amount to the
        disputed invoice and Customer will be responsible for paying the resulting net balance due
        on that invoice.
        9.5 Delinquent Payments. Delinquent payments may bear
        interest at the rate of one-and-one-half percent per month (or the highest rate permitted
        by law, if less) from the payment due date until paid in full. Customer will be responsible
        for all reasonable expenses (including attorneysâ fees) incurred by Google in collecting
        delinquent amounts, except where these delinquent amounts are due to Googleâs billing
        inaccuracies.
        9.6 Purchase Orders.
a. Required. If Customerâs Ordering Document is a Quote,
          then a Purchase Order is required. If Customerâs Ordering Document is an Order Form, and
          Customer wants a Purchase Order number on its invoice, Customer will inform Google and
          will issue a Purchase Order to Google. If Customer requires a Purchase Order, and fails
          to provide the Purchase Order to Google, then Google will not be obligated to provide the
          Services until the Purchase Order has been received by Google.
          b. Not Required. If Customerâs Ordering Document is an
          Order Form, and Customer does not require a Purchase Order number to be included on the
          invoice, Customer must select âNoâ in the Purchase Order section of the Order Form. If
          Customer waives the Purchase Order requirement, then: (a) Google will invoice Customer
          without a Purchase Order; and (b) Customer agrees to pay invoices without a Purchase
          Order.
        
10. Ordering, Overages, and Reporting.
10.1 Ordering. The Fees will be based on the applicable
        Billing Unit. In order to use certain APIs provided as part of the Service, Customer may be
        required to purchase additional SKUs. If Customer orders Asset Tracking as part of the
        Services, the Ordering Document will indicate: (a) whether this Asset Tracking is Tier 1 or
        Tier 2; and (b) the countries within which Customer may use the Services. For any Customer
        Implementation behind a firewall, Customer is required to use the internal Billing Units.
        10.2 Upgrades. Google may, if Customer is not in breach at
        the time of the request, provide Customer an opportunity to purchase higher usage limits.
        10.3 Overages.
a. Page Views. For Customer using Page Views, Google will
          notify Customer before the usage indicated on the Ordering Document has been exceeded. If
          Customer exceeds its usage of Page Views during the License Term, Customer will be
          charged Overages for thirty days following written notice (which may be via email) by
          Google that Customer has exceeded its Page View usage. Following this period, the
          Services may cease functioning.
          b. Other Billing Units. For Customers using other Billing
          Units, Customer must notify Google of any Overages within thirty days of the day the
          Overage occurred. If there is an Overage, Google will invoice Customer, and Customer
          agrees to pay, for the Overage at the Overage rates indicated in the Ordering Document.
        
10.4 Reporting. Customer will promptly report to Google in
        writing if, after the Effective Date, any of the following changes occur: (a) the Customer
        Implementation provides Navigation; (b) the Customer Implementation enables a device to
        detect its own location through use of a Sensor, in order to display the location of the
        device on a map or to calculate a route; (c) if Customer has previously ordered Assets or
        End Users and there is an increase in the number of Assets Tracked per country per month or
        in the number of End Users; or (d) if Customer utilizes an API identified as part of the
        Services as âupgradeable.â Customer may be charged additional fees for any usage pursuant
        to this Section.
      
11. Delivery. The Services will not be made available until
      Google receives either: (a) a complete and duly executed purchase order referencing a Quote
      and this Agreement; or (b) a complete and duly executed Order Form. Google will provide
      Customer with Documentation on using the Services.
      12. Confidentiality.
12.1 Obligations. Each party will: (a) protect the other
        party's Confidential Information with the same standard of care it uses to protect its own
        Confidential Information, but in no event less than reasonable care; and (b) not disclose
        the Confidential Information, except to Affiliates, employees and agents who need to know
        it and who have agreed in writing to keep it confidential. Each party (and any Affiliates,
        employees and agents to whom it has disclosed Confidential Information) may use
        Confidential Information only to exercise rights and fulfill obligations under this
        Agreement, while using reasonable care to protect it. Each party is responsible for any
        actions of its Affiliates, employees and agents in violation of this Section.
        12.2 Exceptions. Confidential Information does not include
        information that: (a) the recipient already knew; (b) becomes public through no fault of
        the recipient; (c) was independently developed by the recipient; or (d) was rightfully
        given to the recipient by another party
        12.3 Required Disclosure. Each party may disclose the other
        party's Confidential Information when required by law, but only after it, if legally
        permissible: (a) uses commercially reasonable efforts to notify the other party; and (b)
        gives the other party the chance to challenge the disclosure.
      
13. Term and Termination.
13.1 Agreement Term. This Agreement will remain in effect for
        the Term.
        13.2 License Term. Subject to Customerâs payment of Fees, the
        term for the license granted in this Agreement will begin on the Delivery Date and will
        continue for the License Term, unless terminated earlier as set forth below.
        Notwithstanding the foregoing, if Customer exceeds its usage of Page Views during the
        License Term, Customer will be charged Overages pursuant to Section 10.3.
        
a. Auto-Renewal. At the end of the License Term, the
          License Term for the Services will automatically renew for consecutive renewal terms of
          twelve months. If a party does not want the Services to automatically renew, then it must
          provide the other party written notice to this effect at least fifteen days prior to the
          end of the then current term. This notice of non renewal will be effective upon the
          conclusion of the then current term.
          b. Revising Rates. Google may revise its rates with at
          least ninety days prior written notice to Customer (which may be via email), effective
          for the following term.
        
13.3 Termination for Breach. Either party may terminate this
        Agreement if: (i) the other party is in material breach of the Agreement and fails to cure
        that breach within thirty days after receipt of written notice; (ii) the other party ceases
        its business operations or becomes subject to insolvency proceedings and the proceedings
        are not dismissed within ninety days; or (iii) the other party is in material breach of
        this Agreement more than two times notwithstanding any cure of such breaches.
        13.4 Other Termination. If Google is prohibited from
        providing the Services in a particular country, Google reserves the right to terminate the
        Agreement with respect to that particular country on written notice.
        13.5 Effect of Termination.
a. Termination for Google's Breach. If the Agreement is
          terminated for Googleâs breach, the licenses granted herein regarding Customerâs use of
          the Services may, at Customerâs option, continue for the remainder of the License Term,
          subject to Customerâs continued compliance with this Agreement. If Customer elects not to
          continue to use the Services, then: (i) the License Term, and all other rights and
          licenses granted by one party to the other and the Services will cease immediately; and
          (ii) upon request, each party will promptly return all Confidential Information of the
          other party.
          b. Termination for Customer's Breach. If the Agreement is
          terminated for Customerâs breach then: (i) the License Term, and all other rights and
          licenses granted by one party to the other and the Services will cease immediately; (ii)
          upon request, each party will promptly return all Confidential Information of the other
          party; and (iii) all payments owed by Customer to Google are immediately due.
          c. Expiration of the License Term. On the expiration of the
          License Term, if Customer does not submit an Ordering Document for a renewal License
          Term, the Services will cease functioning and this Agreement will terminate.
        
14. Representations and Warranties. Each party represents that
      it has the rights, power and authority necessary to enter into this Agreement. Google
      warrants that it will provide the Services in accordance with the Service Level Agreement.
      15. Disclaimer. EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY PROVIDED FOR HEREIN, TO THE
      MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, GOOGLE, ITS LICENSORS, AND THEIR SUPPLIERS
      EXCLUDE ALL WARRANTIES, CONDITIONS, TERMS, REPRESENTATIONS, AND UNDERTAKINGS OF ANY KIND,
      WHETHER EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION WARRANTIES OF
      MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR USE AND NONINFRINGEMENT. GOOGLE, ITS LICENSORS, AND
      THEIR SUPPLIERS, DO NOT WARRANT THAT THE OPERATION OF THE SOFTWARE WILL BE ERROR-FREE OR
      UNINTERRUPTED. THE SERVICES ARE NOT DESIGNED, MANUFACTURED, OR INTENDED FOR HIGH RISK
      ACTIVITIES.
      16. Limitation of Liability.
16.1 Limitation on Indirect Liability. TO THE EXTENT
        PERMITTED BY LAW, NEITHER PARTY, NOR ITS LICENSORS OR SUPPLIERS, WILL BE LIABLE UNDER THIS
        AGREEMENT FOR LOST REVENUES OR INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR
        PUNITIVE DAMAGES, LOSSES OR EXPENSES, EVEN IF THE PARTY KNEW OR SHOULD HAVE KNOWN THAT
        THESE DAMAGES, LOSSES OR EXPENSES, WERE POSSIBLE AND EVEN IF DIRECT DAMAGES DO NOT SATISFY
        A REMEDY.
        16.2 Limitation on Amount of Liability. TO THE EXTENT
        PERMITTED BY LAW, NEITHER PARTY, NOR ITS LICENSORS OR SUPPLIERS, MAY BE HELD LIABLE UNDER
        THIS AGREEMENT FOR MORE THAN THE AMOUNT PAID BY CUSTOMER TO GOOGLE DURING THE TWELVE MONTHS
        PRIOR TO THE EVENT GIVING RISE TO LIABILITY.
        16.3 Exceptions to Limitations. These limitations of
        liability do not apply to breaches of confidentiality obligations or violations of a
        party's Intellectual Property Rights by the other party.
      
17. Indemnification.
17.1 By Google. Google will indemnify, defend, and hold
