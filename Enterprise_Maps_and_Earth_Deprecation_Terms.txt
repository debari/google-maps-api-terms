Last updated: 2015-10-22
Document is subject to change at Googleâs discretion.
          Google will announce if it intends to discontinue or make backwards incompatible changes
          to its APIs or services. Unless a different deprecation period is indicated by Google in
          writing in the applicable APIâs or serviceâs agreement or policies, Google will use
          commercially reasonable efforts to continue to operate the applicable APIs or services
          without these changes until one year after the productâs deprecation announcement unless
          (as Google determines in its reasonable good faith judgment):
        
required by law or third party relationship (including if there is a change in
          applicable law or relationship), or
          
doing so could create a security risk or substantial economic or material technical
          burden.
          
          Your APIs or service agreement, its applicable policies or the productâs documentation
          may contain additional deprecation terms and conditions. In particular:
        
Google Maps APIs Premium Plan - included APIs (for SKUs starting with
            MA4W-)
          
Google Maps API for Business - included APIs (for SKUs starting
            with GM-)
          
          Experimental Features or Functionality
        
          These Deprecation Terms do not apply to versions, features, and functionality labeled as
          "experimental." Experimental versions, features, and functionality may be deprecated at
          any time.
