        Enterprise Maps and Earth Deprecation Terms
      
        Google will announce if it intends to discontinue or make backwards incompatible changes to
        its APIs or services. Unless a different deprecation period is indicated by Google in
        writing in the applicable APIâs or serviceâs agreement or policies, Google will use
        commercially reasonable efforts to continue to operate the applicable APIs or services
        without these changes until one year after the productâs deprecation announcement unless
        (as Google determines in its reasonable good faith judgment):
a. required by law or third party relationship (including if there is a change in
        applicable law or relationship), or
        
b. doing so could create a security risk or substantial economic or material technical
        burden.
        
Your APIs or service agreement, its applicable policies or the productâs documentation
      may contain additional deprecation terms and conditions. In particular:
