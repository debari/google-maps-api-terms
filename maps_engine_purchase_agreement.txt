        the âI Acceptâ button below or, if applicable, the date the Agreement is countersigned (the
        âEffective Dateâ). If you are accepting on behalf of Customer, you represent and warrant
        that: (i) you have full legal authority to bind your employer, or the applicable entity, to
        these terms and conditions; (ii) you have read and understand this Agreement; and (iii) you
        agree, on behalf of the party that you represent, to this Agreement. If you do not have the
        legal authority to bind Customer, please do not click the âI Acceptâ button below (or, if
        applicable, do not sign this Agreement). This Agreement, and the corresponding Ordering
        Document by which Customer orders the Services, sets forth the terms and conditions under
        which Customer may license and use such Services. Ordering Documents are governed by this
        Agreement.
      
        1. Services.
      
          1.1 Generally. Subject to this Agreement, and in consideration of
          Customerâs payment of all Fees, Google will provide the Services to Customer during the
          Term of this Agreement. Google will provide Customer with one or more Admin Accounts for
          use in accessing and administering the Services via the User Interface and Earth Builder
          APIs, loading Customer Data into the Systems, and other relevant features of the
          Services, as applicable. Customerâs use of the Services is subject to the Usage Limits.
        
          1.2 Licenses from Google to Customer.
        
a. To use the Software. Subject to this Agreement, and in
            consideration of Customerâs payment of all Fees, Google grants to Customer, and
            Customer agrees to comply with, a non-sublicensable, non-transferable (except as set
            forth in Section 18.2), non-exclusive, terminable, limited license to use the Software
            in the Territory during the License Term to use the Services.
          
b. To use Google Content. Subject to this Agreement and in
            consideration of Customerâs payment of all Fees, Google grants to Customer, and
            Customer agrees to comply with, a non-sublicensable, non-transferable (except as set
            forth in Section 18.2), non-exclusive, terminable, limited license to access the Google
            Content via the Services in the Territory during the License Term to create Maps, and
            to provide access to these Maps to End Users via the Services.
          
          1.3 License from Customer to Google. If Customer enters Customer Data
          into the Systems, or has Google enter Customer Data into the Systems on Customerâs
          behalf, Google requires a license to that Customer Data so it can process the data and
          provide the Services to Customer. Therefore, by entering Customer Data into the Systems,
          or if Google enters Customer Data into the Systems on Customerâs behalf, Customer grants
          to Google a limited, irrevocable, royalty-free, and non-exclusive license, in the
          Territory, during the License Term, to reproduce, adapt, modify, translate, publicly
          perform, publicly display and distribute the Customer Data solely to enable Google to
          provide the Services to Customer.
        
          1.4 Customer Data.
        
a. Use in the Services. Customer may upload Customer Data into the
            Systems via the methods described in, and this Customer Data will be stored in
            accordance with, the Documentation. Administrators may use the User Interface and
            Services to process Customer Data, either in combination with Google Content or not, in
            order to create and serve Maps to End Users.
          
b. Risk of Loss. Customer Data will not be returned to Customer,
            whether the Customer Data is physically shipped to Google, or entered by Customer or
            Google into the Systems. Customer is solely responsible for backing up its Customer
            Data. Google will not bear any risk of loss for Customer Data.
          
c. Rights. Customer is solely responsible for having, or obtaining,
            any necessary rights, licenses, or authorizations necessary for Customer to provide the
            Customer Data to Google, and for Google to use the Customer Data as stated in this
            Agreement to provide the Services to Customer. Administrators will have access to End
            Usersâ Services usage analytics, such as map views or search terms; Customer is solely
            responsible for determining the scope of its notification to End Users on this topic.
          
d. Data Transfer. As part of providing the Service, Google may store,
            process, and serve Customer Data in the United States or any other country in which
            Google or its agents maintain facilities. By using the Services, Customer consents to
            this transfer, processing and storage of Customer Data.
          
        2. Modifications.
          2.1 To the Services. Google may make commercially reasonable changes to
          the Services from time to time. If Google makes a material change to the Services, Google
          will inform Customer either via the Support Portal, or using the email address Customer
          has provided to Google in order to be notified of such changes.
        
          2.2 To URL Terms. Google may make commercially reasonable changes to the
          URL Terms from time to time. If Google makes a material change to the URL Terms and this
          change results in a material adverse impact on Customer, Customer may notify Google
          within thirty days of the change and remain subject to the URL Terms. If the License Term
          is renewed, it will renew under the updated URL Terms.
        
        3. Payment Terms.
      
          3.1 Purchase Process. Google will provide Customer an Ordering Document
          for each purchase, to confirm the Services, quantity and Fees.
        
          3.2 Payment. All Fees are due thirty days from the invoice date.
          Customerâs obligation to pay all Fees applicable to the License Term is non-cancellable.
          All payments due are in U.S. dollars. Payments made via wire transfer must include the
          following instructions:
        
            Wells Fargo Bank
            Palo Alto, California USA
            ABA# 121000248
            Google Inc.
            Account # 4375669785
          
          3.3 Taxes. Customer is responsible for any Taxes, and Customer will pay
          Google for the Solution without any reduction for Taxes. If Google is obligated to
          collect or pay Taxes, the Taxes will be invoiced to Customer, unless Customer provides
          Google with a timely and valid tax exemption certificate authorized by the appropriate
          taxing authority. In some states the sales tax is due on the total purchase price at the
          time of sale and must be invoiced and remitted in the month of the sale. If Customer is
          required by law to withhold any Taxes from its payments to Google, Customer must provide
          Google with an official tax receipt or other appropriate documentation to support such
          withholding.
        
          3.4 Invoice Disputes. Any invoice disputes must be submitted prior to
          the invoice due date. If the parties determine that certain billing inaccuracies are
          attributable to Google, Google will not issue a corrected invoice, but will instead issue
          a credit memo specifying the incorrect amount in the affected invoice. If the disputed
          invoice has not yet been paid, Google will apply the credit memo amount to the disputed
          invoice and Customer will be responsible for paying the resulting net balance due on that
          invoice.
        
          3.5 Delinquent Payments. Delinquent payments may bear interest at the
          rate of one-and-one-half percent per month (or the highest rate permitted by law, if
          less) from the payment due date until paid in full. Customer will be responsible for all
          reasonable expenses (including attorneysâ fees) incurred by Google in collecting such
          delinquent amounts, except where such delinquent amounts are due to Googleâs billing
          inaccuracies.
        
          3.6 Purchase Orders.
        
a. Required. If Customer requires a purchase order number on its
            invoice, Customer will inform Google and issue a purchase order to Google. If Customer
            requires a purchase order, and fails to provide the purchase order to Google, then
            Google will not be obligated to provide the Solution until the purchase order has been
            received by Google. Any terms and conditions on a purchase order do not apply to this
            Agreement and are null and void.
          
b. Not Required. If Customer does not require a purchase order number
            to be included on the invoice, Customer must select âNoâ in the purchase order section
            of the Order Form. If Customer waives the purchase order requirement, then: (a) Google
            will invoice Customer without a purchase order; and (b) Customer agrees to pay invoices
            without a purchase order.
          
        4. Customer Obligations.
      
          4.1 Compliance. Customer will only use the Services and Software in
          compliance with this Agreement, the Legal Notices, the applicable Documentation, and the
          Acceptable Use Policy. Customer may only use the Services in accordance with the SKUs,
          and the corresponding Usage Limits, specified in the applicable Ordering Document and
          Agreement.
        
          4.2 Territory. The Customer entity signing this Agreement must be
          located in the Territory. Note that the Territory is neither an End User restriction, nor
          a restriction on where Customer may have subsidiaries or affiliates.
        
          4.3 Administration of the Services.
        
a. Generally. Customer may specify one or more Administrators who may
            access the Admin Account and administer the Services. Customer is responsible for: (a)
            maintaining the confidentiality of the password and Admin Account; (b) designating
            those of its employees who are authorized to access the Admin Account; and (c) ensuring
            that all activities that occur in connection with the Admin Account comply with the
            Agreement.
          
b. Access and Use Rights. Customer may specify particular rights
            regarding the access, viewing, editing, or consuming of its Maps to a specific set of
            End Users. Customer will also have the ability to delegate administrative rights to the
            Services to third parties, and is solely responsible for its decision to do so.
          
          4.4 Unauthorized Use. Customer will use all commercially reasonable
          efforts to prevent unauthorized use of the Service, and to terminate any unauthorized
          use. Customer will promptly notify Google of any unauthorized use of, or access to, the
          Services of which it becomes aware.
        
          4.5 End User Consent. Customerâs Administrators may have the ability to
          access, monitor, use, or disclose data regarding End Users use of the Services. Customer
          will obtain and maintain all required consents from End Users to allow: (i) Customerâs
          access, monitoring, use and disclosure of this data and Google providing Customer with
          the ability to do so and (ii) Google to provide the Services.
        
          4.6 Third Party Removal Requests. Customer is solely responsible for
          responding to third party complaints regarding, or third party requests to remove,
          Customer Data. If received by Google, Google will forward these complaints or requests to
          Customer for resolution. Customer is also responsible for communicating to third parties
          a process by which these complaints or requests can be sent directly to Customer.
        
          4.7 Domains. The Customer must own the domains listed on the Order Form.
          Customer may add additional domains either by submitting a request to Google support
          personnel, or by using the available online Google tools to do so. Prior to providing the
          Services, Google may verify that Customer owns or controls the domains. If Customer does
          not own or control the domains, then Google will have no obligation to provide Customer
          with the Services.
        
          4.8 Google Content Terms. If Maps include Google Content, then Customer
          must not obscure, alter, or remove any included terms or the Legal Notices presented as
          part of the Maps. If Maps include static maps or HTTP services, Customer must incorporate
          a link to the Earth Terms and Legal Notices in a license agreement governing End Usersâ
          use of the Maps. Customer must notify Google if Customer becomes aware of any End Userâs
          non-compliance with the Earth Terms, Legal Notices, or the AUP.
        
        5. Ownership.
      
          5.1 Generally. Except as expressly set forth herein, this Agreement does
          not grant either party any rights, implied or otherwise, to the otherâs content or any of
          the otherâs Intellectual Property Rights. Intellectual Property Rights in and to the
          content accessed through the Services are the property of the applicable content owner
          and may be protected by applicable laws.
        
          5.2 Brand Features. Any use of a partyâs Brand Features will inure to
          the benefit of the party holding rights in those Brand Features. Each party agrees not
          to: (a) challenge or assist others to challenge the other partyâs Brand Features or
          registration thereof (except to protect such partyâs rights with respect to its own Brand
          Features); or (b) attempt to register any Brand Features that are confusingly similar to
          those of the other party.
        
        6. Export Compliance.   Customer will comply with, and will
        obtain all prior authorization from the competent government authorities required by, the
        Export Control Laws. Customer will not use the Services, directly or indirectly, for
        purposes of nuclear activities, biological weapons, chemical weapons, missile technology,
        or other end uses prohibited by the Export Control Laws.
      
        7. Support.
          7.1 TSS. Google will provide TSS to Customer in accordance with the TSSG
          for the License Term. Unless otherwise agreed in writing, to receive TSS Customer must
          provide Google with reasonably required access to the Services in accordance with the
          TSSG. Customerâs failure to provide this access will be at Customerâs own risk and
          without liability to Google. If the Ordering Document does not identify a support level,
          then Google will provide Standard Support. Google may change the TSS from time to time,
          but not if the changes materially adversely impact Customer.
        
          7.2 Updates. TSS includes Updates. Customerâs use of Updates is subject
          to this Agreement and the Ordering Document. Customer will install Updates in accordance
          with the TSSG.
        
        8. Delivery.   The Services will not be made available
        until Google receives either: (a) a complete and duly executed purchase order referencing a
        Quote and this Agreement; or (b) a complete and duly executed Order Form. Google will
        provide Customer with Documentation on using the Services.
      
        9. Ordering, Usage Limits, and Overages.
      
          9.1 Ordering. Google will provide Customer an Ordering Document for each
          purchase, to confirm the Services, quantity, and price. The Fees will be based on the
          SKUs in the Ordering Document.
        
          9.2 Usage Limits and Overages. The Services will cease functioning if
          Customer attempts to exceed the Usage Limits without having ordered an Overage SKU. In
          order for the Services to continue functioning in excess of the Usage Limits, Customer
          must enter into a new Ordering Document that contains an Overage SKU. Google will then
          invoice Customer, and Customer agrees to pay, for the Overage pursuant to the Overage SKU
          in the Ordering Document.
        
          9.3 Renewal. Upon each auto-renewal pursuant to Section 13.3: (a)
          Customerâs Map Views for purposes of the Usage Limits, will be reset to zero; (b)

          term; and (c) Google will invoice Customer, and Customer agrees to pay, for the renewal
          of the Services as set forth in the applicable Ordering Document.
        
        10. Confidential Information.
      
          10.1 Obligations. Each party will: (a) protect the other partyâs
          Confidential Information with the same standard of care it uses to protect its own
          Confidential Information; and (b) not disclose the Confidential Information, except to
          affiliates, employees and agents who need to know it and who have agreed in writing to
          keep it confidential. Each party (and any affiliates, employees and agents to whom it has
          disclosed Confidential Information) may use Confidential Information only to exercise
          rights and fulfill obligations under this Agreement, while using reasonable care to
          protect it. Each party is responsible for any actions of its affiliates, employees and
          agents in violation of this Section.
        
          10.2 Exceptions. Confidential Information does not include information
          that: (a) the recipient already knew; (b) becomes public through no fault of the
          recipient; (c) was independently developed by the recipient; or (d) was rightfully given
          to the recipient by another party.

          other party the chance to challenge the disclosure.
        
        11. Publicity.   Customer agrees that Google may include
        Customerâs name or Brand Features in a list of Google customers. Customer also agrees that
        Google may verbally reference Customer as a customer of the Google products or services
        that are the subject of this Agreement. This section is subject to Section 5.2.
      
        12. Restrictions.
      
          12.1 General. Customer will not, and will not allow others to: (a) copy
          the Software; (b) use the Services for High Risk Activities; (c) use the Services to
          create a substantially similar product or service; (d) display any advertising in
          connection with its use of the Services; (e) extract any Google Content to be used
          outside of the Services; (g) use the Services to store or transfer any Customer Data that
          is controlled for export under Export Control Laws; or (h) use the Services on behalf of
          or for the benefit of any entity or person who is prohibited from using the Services by
          the laws or regulations of the United States, including but not limited to parties listed
          on the SDN List.
        
          12.2 Cache Restrictions. Unless Google specifically agrees in writing,
          Customer will not: (a) use, distribute, or sell any Google Content outside of the Maps;
          (b) incorporate or embed Google Content or components of the Services into any of
          Customerâs products or services that it sells to third parties; or (c) offer the
          Services, or any Customer products, services, or solutions based upon the Services, on a
          subscription basis to End Users.
        
          12.3 Required Disclosure. Customer may not pre-fetch, retrieve, cache,
          index, or store any Google Content, or portion of the Services with the exception being
          Customer may store limited amounts of Google Content solely to improve the performance of
          the Services due to network latency, and only if Customer does so temporarily, securely,
          and in a manner that: (a) does not permit use of the Google Content outside of the
          Services; (b) is session-based only (once the browser is closed, any additional storage
          is prohibited); (c) does not manipulate or aggregate any Google Content or portion of the
          Services; (d) does not prevent Google from accurately tracking Usage Limits; and (e) does
          not modify or adjust attribution.
        
          12.4 Development and Evaluation Accounts. Development and Evaluation
          Accounts may only be used for development, evaluation, educational purposes, or some
          combination thereof. Services from a Development and Evaluation Account may not be used
          in a commercial environment.
        
          12.5 Client IDs. If a Customer Map does not automatically include
          Customerâs Client ID, Customer must implement the Client IDs according to the
          Documentation. Customerâs failure to use a Client ID provided by Google may result in
          Google not providing the Services in whole or in part, and will relieve Google of its
          obligations to provide TSS.
        
          12.6 Asset Tracking. A Customer Map may only Tracks Assets via the
          Spatial Data API.
        
          12.7 Third Party Components. Any third party component embedded,
          included or provided for use with the Software may only be used in conjunction with the
          Software, and this use is subject to this Agreement and the Documentation. However, to
          the extent Software include components governed by open source licenses with provisions
          inconsistent with this Agreement, those components are instead governed solely by the
          applicable open source licenses. To the extent Software include components covered by
          open source licenses requiring the provision of corresponding source code for those
          components, Google hereby offers such source code consistent with those licenses.
        
        13. Term and Termination.
      
          13.1 Agreement Term. This Agreement will remain in effect for the Term.
        
          13.2 License Term. Google will provide the Services to Customer, and the
          term of the licenses granted in this Agreement will continue, for the License Term.

          applicable renewal, the Services and the license to use the Software will automatically
          renew for an additional term of twelve months using the SKUs in effect at the time of
          auto renewal. If a party does not want the Services to renew, then it must provide the
          other party written notice to this effect at least fifteen days prior to the end of the
          then current License Term. This notice of non renewal will be effective upon the
          conclusion of the then current License Term.
        
          13.4 Termination for Breach. Either party may terminate this Agreement
          if: (i) the other party is in material breach of the Agreement and fails to cure that
          breach within thirty days after receipt of written notice; (ii) the other party ceases
          its business operations or becomes subject to insolvency proceedings and the proceedings
          are not dismissed within ninety days; or (iii) the other party is in material breach of
