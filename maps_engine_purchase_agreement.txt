        Google Enterprise Geo Master License-Google Maps Engine
      
        This Google Enterprise Geo Master Agreement for the licensing of Google
        Enterprise Maps and Earth Products and Services (the âAgreementâ) is made and entered into
        by and between Google Inc. (âGoogleâ) and the customer identified below and/or on the
        Ordering Document(s)(âCustomerâ). This Agreement, each accompanying addendum and each
        accompanying Ordering Document governs Customerâs access to and use of the Products and
        Services.
      
        This Agreement is effective on the date mutually agreed by the parties (âEffective Dateâ).
      
          1. Product and Services Terms and Conditions.
        
            1.1 The Agreement is a master agreement. The Customer must have the
            Agreement in effect to obtain Products and Services. Customer may obtain Products and
            Services by entering into a corresponding Addendum. The parties will execute the
            Agreement first and are subject to an agreed term. An Addendum is entered separately
            and is subject to its own terms.
          
            1.2 Generally Applicable Product and Services Terms. Except as
            otherwise permitted by the Product or Service in the Documentation, Customer will not,
            and will not allow others to: (a) copy Software except as explicitly authorized; (b)
            use the Products and Services for High Risk Activities; (c) use the Product and
            Services to create a substantially similar products or services; or (d) extract any
            Google Content for use outside of the Products.
          
            1.3 Separate Use. Unless otherwise authorized by Google, Customer will
            not: (a) distribute or sell Google Content; (b) incorporate or embed Google Content or
            components of the Products and Services into any of Customer's products or services
            that it makes available to third parties; or (c) offer the Services, or any Customer
            products and services based upon the Services, on a subscription basis to
            third-parties.
          
            1.4 Third-Party Components. Any third party component embedded,
            included or provided for use with the Software may only be used in conjunction with the
            Software, and this use is subject to this Agreement and any applicable Addendum and
            Documentation. However, to the extent Software includes components governed by open
            source licenses with provisions inconsistent with this Agreement, those components are
            instead governed solely by the applicable open source licenses. To the extent Software
            includes components covered by open source licenses requiring the provision of
            corresponding source code, Google hereby offers such source code consistent with those
            licenses.
          
            1.5 Software Restrictions. If Customer licenses Software under this
            Agreement, then Customer, except as expressly permitted in an Addendum, will not (and
            will not allow any third party to): (a) use or reproduce, modify, create derivative
            works, decompile, disassemble, or otherwise reverse engineer the Software or attempt to
            reconstruct or discover any source code, underlying ideas, algorithms, file formats or
            programming interfaces of the Software by (except and only to the extent that
            applicable law prohibits or restricts reverse engineering restrictions), or incorporate
            the Software into or with other software; (b) distribute, sell, sublicense, rent, lease
            to third parties or otherwise make the Software functionality available to third
            parties except as set forth herein; or (c) remove or in any manner alter any Software
            identification, proprietary, trademark, copyright or other notices.
          
            1.6 Customer Data.
a. Services Use. Customer may upload Customer Data into the
            Systems via the methods described in, and this Customer Data will be stored in
            accordance with, the Documentation.
            
b. Risk of Loss. Customer Data will not be returned to Customer,
            whether the Customer Data is physically provided to Google, or entered by Customer or
            Google into the Systems. Customer is solely responsible for backing up its Customer
            Data. Google will not bear any risk of loss for any data.
            
c. Customer Rights in Customer Data. Customer is solely
            responsible for having, or obtaining, any necessary rights, licenses, or authorizations
            necessary for Customer to provide the Customer Data to Google, and for Google to use
            the Customer Data as stated in this Agreement to provide the Services to Customer.
            Customer is solely responsible for determining the scope of its notification
            obligations to Customer Data and any other persons whose tracked data and other
            information is included in Customer Data.
            
d. Customer Data Transfer. As part of providing the Service,
            Google may store, process, and serve Customer Data in the United States or any other
            country in which Google or its agents maintain facilities. By using the Services,
            Customer consents to this transfer, processing and storage of Customer Data.
            
          2. Technical Support Services.
        
            2.1 Technical Support Service (TSS). Subject to Customer's payment of
            all due and payable Fees and its compliance with this Agreement and its applicable
            Addendum's terms, Google will provide TSS for Products and Services in accordance with
            the applicable TSSG for the term agreed in an Ordering Document. Unless otherwise
            agreed in writing, to receive TSS Customer must provide Google with reasonable access
            to the Products and Services. Customer's failure to provide access will be at
            Customer's own risk. If the Ordering Document does not identify a support level, then
            Google will provide standard or Basic TSS as defined in the TSSG. Google may, from time
            to time, change the TSS.
          
            2.2 Updates. TSS includes Updates, to the extent available, to the
            given Product or Service. Customer will only receive Updates if Customer is receiving
            TSS. Customer's access to and use of TSS is subject to this Agreement's terms, the
            applicable Addendum and the Ordering Document. Customer will implement Updates in
            accordance with the Technical Support Service Guidelines ("TSSG"). Customer may, if
            possible, make an Update copy to facilitate installation and will destroy the copy
            after use.
          
          3. Term and Termination.
        
            3.1 Agreement Term. Subject to Customer's payment of all due and
            payable Fees and compliance with this Agreement's terms, the Agreement begins on the
            Effective Date and will continue until the end of the last Addendum term(s) unless
            terminated earlier as set forth below ("Initial Term"). An Addendum's term is set forth
            in the respective Addendum.
          
            3.2 Auto-Renewal. At the end of the Initial Term, and unless otherwise
            indicated in an Addendum, the Agreement will automatically renew for consecutive twelve
            month renewal terms. If a party does not want the Agreement to automatically renew,
            then it must provide the other party a written termination notice at least 15 days
            prior to the then current term's expiration date. A party's timely non-renewal notice
            will be effective upon the then current term's expiration. Google will invoice
            Customer, and Customer agrees to pay, for the renewal of Products and Services as set
            forth in the applicable Ordering Document. An Addendum's renewal term, if any, will be
            set forth in the respective Addendum.
          
            3.3 Termination for Breach. Either party may terminate this Agreement
            or an Addendum if: (a) the other party is in material breach of the Agreement or an
            Addendum and fails to cure that breach within 30 days after receipt of written notice;
            (b) the other party ceases its business operations or becomes subject to insolvency
            proceedings and the proceedings are not dismissed within 90 days; or (c) the other
            party materially breaches this Agreement or an Addendum more than two times
            notwithstanding any cure of these breaches.
          
            3.4 Effect of Termination.
a. Termination for Google's Breach.
            
                  (i) Agreement Termination. If the Agreement is terminated for
                  Google's breach, the rights granted hereunder may, at Customer's option, continue
                  for the remainder of all then effective Addendum(s)'s term(s), subject to
                  Customer's continued compliance with this Agreement and the corresponding
                  Addendum(s). If Customer elects not to continue under the Agreement, then the
                  Agreement and all accompanying then-effective Addendum(s) will terminate.
                  Customer must make its election to proceed or not proceed under the Agreement
                  upon the Customer's declaration of Google's Agreement breach. If Customer elects
                  to continue the Agreement it further commits to continue all Addendum(s).
                
                  (ii) Addendum Termination. If an Addendum is terminated for
                  Google's breach, the rights granted under the Addendum may, at Customer's option,
                  continue for the remainder of the breached Addendum's term, subject to Customer's
                  continued compliance with this Agreement and the continued Addendum. If Customer
                  elects not to continue to under the breached Addendum, then the Addendum will
                  terminate. Customer must make its election to proceed or not proceed under the
                  Agreement upon the Customer's declaration of Google's Addendum breach.
                
b. Termination for Customer's Breach. If the Agreement or an
            Addendum is terminated for Customer's breach then: (i) the License Term and all other
            rights and licenses granted by Google to Customer under the Agreement and its
            Addendum(s) for the Products and Services will cease immediately and (ii) all payments
            owed by Customer to Google are immediately due and payable.
            
            3.5 Effect of Expiration. If the Agreement expires, the Addendum(s)
            does not expire until the expiration of its respective term(s). If an Addendum survives
            Agreement termination or expiration, the Agreement will remain in effect with respect
            to that Addendum until the Addendum expires. If an Addendum expires the Agreement will
            stay in effect and any other Addendum in Effect with stay in effect unless otherwise
            provided.
          
          4. Orders and Payment.
        
            4.1 Purchase Process. Google will provide Customer an Ordering
            Document for each transaction to confirm the acquired Products and Services and their
            respective quantities and Fees. The Ordering Document is incorporated into and governed
            by this Agreement.
          
            4.2 Payment. All Fees are due 30 days from the invoice date.
            Customer's obligation to pay Fees is non-cancellable. All payments due are in U.S.
            dollars. Payments made via wire transfer must include the following instructions:
          
            Wells Fargo Bank
            Palo Alto, California USA
            ABA# 121000248
            Google Inc.
            Account # 4375669785
            4.3 Taxes. Customer is responsible for any applicable Taxes without
            reduction. If Google is obligated to collect or pay Taxes, the Taxes will be invoiced
            to Customer, unless Customer provides Google with a valid tax exemption certificate. If
            Customer is required by law to withhold any Taxes from its payments to Google, Customer
            must provide Google with an official tax receipt or other appropriate documentation to
            support this withholding.
          
            4.4 Invoice Disputes. Any invoice disputes must be submitted prior to
            the invoice due date. If the parties determine that certain billing inaccuracies are
            attributable to Google, Google will not issue a corrected invoice, but will instead
            issue a credit memo specifying the incorrect amount in the affected invoice. If the
            disputed invoice has not yet been paid, Google will apply the credit memo amount to the
            disputed invoice and Customer will be responsible for paying the resulting net balance
            due on that invoice.
          
            4.5 Delinquent Payments. Delinquent payments may bear interest at the
            rate of one-and-one-half percent per month (or the highest rate permitted by law, if
            less) from the payment due date until paid in full. Customer will be responsible for
            all reasonable expenses (including attorneys' fees) incurred by Google in collecting
            delinquent amounts, except where these delinquent amounts are due to Google's billing
            inaccuracies.
          
            4.6 Purchases and Orders.
          
a. Orders. Product and Service order requirements will be set
            forth in this Agreement and each accompanying Addendum.
            
b. Purchase Orders. If Customerâs Ordering Document is a quote,
            then a Purchase Order is required. If Customerâs Ordering Document is an order form,
            and Customer wants a Purchase Order number on its invoice, Customer will inform Google
            and will issue a Purchase Order number to Google. If Customer requires a Purchase
            Order, and fails to provide the Purchase Order number to Google, then Google will not
            be obligated to provide the Products and Services until Google receives the Purchase
            Order. Any terms and conditions on a Purchase Order do not apply to this Agreement or
            any Addendum and are null and void.
            
c. Delivery. The Products and Services will not be made available
            until Google receives either: (i) a complete and duly executed Purchase Order
            referencing a quote and this Agreement; or (ii) a complete and duly executed order
            form.
            
            4.7 Serving Quota. Customer may not exceed Serving Quota. In order for
            the Products and Services to continue functioning in excess of the Serving Quota,
            Customer must enter into a new Ordering Document for the additional Products and
            Services.
          
          5. Intellectual Property Rights Ownership and Publicity.
        
            5.1 Intellectual Property Rights Generally. Except as expressly in
            this Agreement or in an Addendum, this Agreement does not grant either party any
            rights, implied or otherwise, to the otherâs content or any of the otherâs Intellectual
            Property Rights. Intellectual Property Rights in and to the content accessed through
            the Products and Services are the property of the applicable content owner and may be
            protected by applicable laws.
          
            5.2 Brand Features. If, to the extent possible, Customer wants to
            display Google Brand Features in connection with its use of the Products and Services,
            Customer will comply with the Trademark Guidelines. Customer will not alter any Google
            Content generated by the Products or Services to remove any Brand Feature or
            proprietary notice of Google or its licensors. Any use of a partyâs Brand Features will
            inure to the benefit of the party holding rights in those Brand Features. Each party
            agrees not to: (a) challenge or assist others to challenge the other partyâs Brand
            Features or registration thereof (except to protect that partyâs rights with respect to
            its own Brand Features) or (b) attempt to register any Brand Features that are
            confusingly similar to those of the other party.
          
            5.3 Publicity. Customer agrees that Google may include Customerâs name
            or Brand Features in a list of Google customers, whether online or in offline
            promotional materials. Customer also agrees that Google may verbally reference Customer
            as Google client.
          
          6. Export Compliance.
        
            Customer will comply with and will obtain all required authorizations from applicable
            government authorities under all applicable export and reexport control laws and
            regulations with respect to its Product and Services use, including the Export
            Administration Regulations ("EAR") maintained by the U.S. Department of Commerce, trade
            and economic sanctions maintained by the Treasury Departmentâs Office of Foreign Assets
            Control, and the International Traffic in Arms Regulations ("ITAR") maintained by the
            Department of State. This section will survive Agreement termination or expiration.
          
          7. Confidentiality.
        
            7.1 Obligations. Each party will: (a) protect the other partyâs
            Confidential Information with the same standard of care it uses to protect its own
            Confidential Information, but in no event less than reasonable care; and (b) not
            disclose the Confidential Information, except to Affiliates, employees and agents who
            need to know it and who have agreed in writing to keep it confidential. Each party (and
            any Affiliates, employees and agents to whom it has disclosed Confidential Information)
            may use Confidential Information only to exercise rights and fulfill obligations under
            this Agreement, while using reasonable care to protect it. Each party is responsible
            for any actions of its Affiliates, employees and agents in violation of this section.
            Either party may demand the return of Confidential Information at any time upon written
            notice to the other party.
          
            7.2 Exceptions. Confidential Information does not include information
            that: (a) the recipient already knew; (b) becomes public through no fault of the
            recipient; (c) was independently developed by the recipient; or (d) was rightfully
            given to the recipient by another party.
          
            7.3 Required Disclosure. The recipient may disclose Confidential
            Information when required by law after giving reasonable notice to the discloser if
            allowed by law.
          
            7.4 Services Confidentiality. The Service functionality and pricing is
            Googleâs Confidential Information.
          
          8. Warranty Disclaimer.
        
            EXCEPT AS EXPLICITLY PROVIDED IN THIS AGREEMENT OR IN AN ADDENDUM, AND TO THE MAXIMUM
            EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, GOOGLE, ITS LICENSORS, AND THEIR SUPPLIERS DO NOT
            MAKE ANY OTHER WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, WHETHER EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE,
            INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
            USE AND NONINFRINGEMENT. GOOGLE, ITS LICENSORS, AND THEIR SUPPLIERS, DO NOT WARRANT
            THAT THE OPERATION OF THE PRODUCTS OR SERVICES WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED AND ERROR FREE.
            THE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES ARE NOT DESIGNED, INTENDED OR MANUFACTURED FOR HIGH RISK
            ACTIVITIES.
          
          9. Limitation of Liability.
        
            9.1 Limitation on Indirect Liability. NEITHER PARTY, NOR ITS LICENSORS
            OR SUPPLIERS, WILL, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, BE LIABLE UNDER THIS
            AGREEMENT FOR LOST REVENUES, EXPENSES OR LOSSES OR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL,
            CONSEQUENTIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, EVEN IF THE PARTY KNEW OR SHOULD HAVE
            KNOWN THAT THESE DAMAGES WERE POSSIBLE AND EVEN IF DIRECT DAMAGES DO NOT SATISFY A
            REMEDY.
          
            9.2 Limitation on Amount of Liability. NEITHER PARTY, NOR ITS
            LICENSORS OR SUPPLIERS, MAY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, BE HELD LIABLE
            UNDER THIS AGREEMENT FOR MORE THAN THE AMOUNT PAID OR PAYABLE BY CUSTOMER TO GOOGLE
            DURING THE TWELVE MONTHS PRIOR TO THE EVENT GIVING RISE TO LIABILITY.
          
            9.3 Exceptions to Limitations. These limitations of liability do not
            apply to breaches of confidentiality obligations or violations of a partyâs
            Intellectual Property Rights by the other party.
          
          10. Indemnification.
        
            10.1 By Google. Google will indemnify, defend, and hold harmless
            Customer from and against all liabilities, damages, and costs (including settlement
            costs and reasonable attorneysâ fees) arising out of a third party claim that the
            Products or the technology used to provide the Services infringes or mis-appropriates
            any patent, copyright, trade secret or trademark of that third party.
          
            10.2 Exceptions. The obligations set forth in Section 10.1 do not
            apply if the third party claim is caused by, or results from: (a) Customerâs
            combination or use of the Products and Services with software, services, or products
            developed by Customer or third parties, if the claim would have been avoided by the
            non-combined or independent use of the Products and Services; (b) modification of the
            Products or Services, by anyone other than Google if the third party claim would have
            been avoided by use of the unmodified Products or Service; (c) Customerâs continued
            allegedly infringing activity after being notified thereof or after being provided
            modifications that would have avoided the alleged infringement; (d) Customerâs use of
            the Products or Services in a manner not in accordance with this Agreement, an Addendum
            or the Documentation; or (e) use of other than Googleâs most current release of the
            Products or Services if the third party claim would have been avoided by use of the
            most current release.
          
            10.3 By Customer. Unless prohibited by applicable law and without
            waiving sovereign immunity, Customer will indemnify, defend, and hold harmless Google
            from and against all liabilities, damages, losses, expenses and costs (including
            settlement costs and reasonable attorneysâ fees) arising out of (a) a third party claim
            made against Google for infringement of the third party rights listed in Section 10.1
            based on conduct by Customer as described in Section 10.2; (b) Customerâs breach of
            Section 6 (Export Compliance); or (c) Customerâs use of the Software or Services in
            violation of an End Userâs privacy.
          
            10.4 Infringement Remedies. If Google reasonably believes the Products
            or Services infringes a third partyâs Intellectual Property Rights, then Google will:
            (a) procure for Customer the right to continue to use the Products or Services; (b)
            replace the infringing Products or Services; or (c) modify the infringing Products or
            Services to avoid the alleged infringement. If Google determines the options in this
            Section are not commercially reasonable, Google may terminate the license for the
            allegedly infringing Products or Services and will provide a pro-rata refund of the
            paid but unearned Fees applicable to the period following the Products or Services

            indemnifying party of all damages and costs finally awarded for the claim, or
            settlement costs approved in writing by the indemnifying party. The indemnifying party
            has full control and authority over the defense, except that: (a) any settlement
            requiring the party seeking indemnification to admit liability or to pay any money will
            require that partyâs prior written consent, which will not be unreasonably withheld or
            delayed; and (b) the other party may join in the defense with its own counsel at its
            own expense. THE INDEMNITIES ABOVE ARE A PARTYâS ONLY REMEDY UNDER THIS AGREEMENT FOR
            VIOLATION BY THE OTHER PARTY OF A THIRD PARTYâS INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS.

            provide Google with a certification signed by a Customer officer verifying the Products
            or Services are being used in compliance with this Agreement. Furthermore, Google will
            have the right, no more than once per calendar year, and upon at least 30 days prior
            written notice, to appoint a nationally recognized certified public accountant or
            independent auditor to examine and verify Customerâs Agreement compliance. Audits will
            be conducted during regular business hours at Customerâs facilities and will not
            unreasonably interfere with Customerâs business activities. Customer will provide
            Google with reasonable access to the relevant Customer records and facilities. If an
            audit reveals that Customer has underpaid fees to Google during the period audited,
            then Google will invoice Customer, and Customer will promptly pay Google, for the
            underpaid fees based on the higher of the price specified in this Agreement or Googleâs
            price list in effect at the time the audit is completed. If the underpaid fees exceed
            five percent of the license fees paid by Customer for the Products or Services during
            the preceding six-month period, then Customer will also pay Googleâs reasonable audit
            costs.

              Privacy Policy. Customer must maintain its own copy of all Customer Data and Google
              may delete Customer Data from its systems at any time. The terms "personal data",
              "data subject", "processing" and "data processor" will have the meanings ascribed to
              them under applicable European Union directives. Google will take and implement
              appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect such personal data

              unauthorized disclosure or access.
