        Google Maps for WorkâService Level Agreement (âMaps API SLAâ)
      
Service Level Agreement. Google will use reasonable commercial efforts
            to provide Maps API web and mobile interfaces that are operating and available to
            Customers 99.9% of the time in any calendar month. In the event Customer experiences
            any of the Service performance issues defined below due to the unavailability of
            Services, Customer will be eligible to receive Service Credits.
          
Customer Service Credit Request. In order to receive Service Credits,
            Customer must notify Google within thirty (30) days from the time Customer believes it
            is eligible to receive a Service Credit. Failure to comply with this requirement will
            forfeit Customer's right to receive a Service Credit.
          
Maximum Service Credit. The aggregate maximum number of Service
            Credits to be issued by Google to Customer for any and all Downtime Periods that occur
            in a single calendar month will not exceed fifteen days of Service added to the end of
            Customerâs term for the Service. Service Credits may not be exchanged for, or converted
            to, monetary compensation.
          
Maps API SLA Exclusions. The Maps API SLA does not apply to any
            Service(s) that expressly exclude this Maps API SLA (as stated in the documentation for
            such services) and any performance issues: (i) caused by factors outside of Google's
            reasonable control; (ii) that resulted from any actions or inactions of Customer or any
            third parties; or (iii) that resulted from Customer's equipment and/or third party
            equipment (not within the primary control of Google). This Maps API SLA states
            Customer's sole and exclusive remedy for any failure by Google to meet this Maps API
            SLA.

"Application" means one of the mobile applications authorized to
              use a static build of the Google Maps Android API or the Google Maps SDK for iOS.
              
"Downtime" means, for a Domain or Application, if average
              latency is greater than three seconds. Downtime is measured based on server side
              error rate.
              
"Downtime Period" means, for a Domain, a period of ten
              consecutive minutes of Downtime. Intermittent Downtime for a period of less than ten
              minutes will not be counted towards any Downtime Periods.
              
"Monthly Uptime Percentage" means total number of minutes in a
              calendar month minus the number of minutes of Downtime suffered from all Downtime

              month.
              
"Scheduled Downtime" means those times where Google notifies
              Customers of periods of Downtime seven days prior to the commencement of such
              Downtime. There will be no more than twelve hours of Scheduled Downtime per calendar
              year. Scheduled Downtime is not considered Downtime for purposes of this Maps API

"Service Credit" means: (a) three days of Service added to the
              end of Customerâs term for the Service, at no charge to Customer, if the Monthly

              days of Service added to the end of Customerâs term for the Service, at no charge to
