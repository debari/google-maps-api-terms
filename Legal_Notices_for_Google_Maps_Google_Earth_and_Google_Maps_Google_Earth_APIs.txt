          Google is providing the following notices under applicable laws and contracts (the
          "Legal Notices").
        
          The Legal Notices are incorporated by reference into the Google Maps/Google Earth Additional Terms of Service and the
          Google Maps/Google Earth APIs Terms of
          Service.
          By accessing, downloading, or using Google Maps/Google Earth or the Google Maps/Google
          Earth APIs (collectively, the "Service(s)"), you are agreeing to be
          bound by these Legal Notices.
        
          Unless otherwise specified, capitalized terms used in these Legal Notices have the
          meanings given to them in the Google Terms of Service, the
          Google Maps/Google Earth Additional Terms of Service,
          and the Google Maps/Google Earth
          APIs Terms of Service.
        
Standards. The Services rely on widely recognized international
              standards for naming and mapping conventions. For example, for country and territory
              naming, we rely primarily on the ISO-3166 standard, which is recognized by
              the UN Statistics Division.
