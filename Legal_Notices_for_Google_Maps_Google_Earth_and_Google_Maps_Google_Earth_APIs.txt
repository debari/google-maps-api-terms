          Legal Notices for Google Maps/Google Earth and Google Maps/Google Earth APIs
        
          The following are various legal notices that Google is obligated to provide by law and/or
          by contract (the "Legal Notices"). The Legal Notices are incorporated by reference into
          the Google Maps/Google Earth
          Terms of Service and the Google
          Maps/Google Earth APIs Terms of Service. By using Google Maps, Google Earth, or the
          Google Maps/Google Earth APIs (collectively, the "Products"), you are
          agreeing to be bound by these Legal Notices. Unless otherwise specified, capitalized
          terms used in these Legal Notices have the meanings described in the Google Terms of Service, the Google Maps/Google Earth Terms of
          Service, and the Google
          Maps/Google Earth APIs Terms of Service.
        
1 Standards. Google Maps and Google Earth rely on widely-recognized
          international standards for naming and mapping conventions. For example, for country and
          territory naming, we rely primarily on the 
          ISO-3166 standard, which is recognized by the UN Statistics Division.
        
2 U.S. Government Restricted Rights. If any Product is used or accessed
          by or on behalf of the United States government, such use or access is subject to the
          following provision. The Products and any related documentation are deemed "commercial
          computer software" and "commercial computer software documentation," respectively, within
          the meaning of the applicable civilian and military Federal acquisition regulations and
          any supplement thereto. If the user of the Product is an agency, department, employee, or
          other entity of the United States Government, the use, duplication, reproduction,
          release, modification, disclosure, or transfer of the Products, including technical data,
          manuals or other accompanying documentation, is restricted by the terms, conditions and
          covenants contained in the Google Maps/Google Earth Terms of Service and the Google
          Maps/Google Earth APIs Terms of Service. In accordance with Federal Acquisition
          Regulation 12.212 for civilian agencies and Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation
          Supplement 227.7202 for military agencies, use of the Products is further restricted by
          the Google Maps/Google Earth Terms of Service and the Google Maps/Google Earth APIs Terms
          of Service.
