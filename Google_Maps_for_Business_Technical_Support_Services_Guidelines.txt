        Google Maps for Business : Technical Support Services Guidelines
      
Introduction
        Google will make available technical support services for Customerâs Google Maps for
        Business Products and Services ("Products and Services") as provided in
        this Technical Support Service Guideline ("TSSG"). This TSSG supplements
        the Google Maps for Business Products and Services terms and conditions as entered into
        between Google and Customer (the "Agreement").
      
        1. Covered Products and Services
        Except as otherwise provided below, Google will, upon Customerâs payment of all applicable
        fees, provide technical support services for the Products and Services identified in
        Section 2. Please note that not all technical support services are available for all
        Products and Services.
      
        2. Technical Support Service Request Submission
          A. Support Levels. Google will provide Customer either Basic, Standard,
          or Premium Support, as indicated in the applicable ordering document. If the ordering
          document does not identify a specific Support Level, then Google will provide Basic
          Support or Standard Support, as described here:
        
              Product
            
              Basic

          1. A minimum purchase is required to qualify for Standard Support Level for all Products
          and Services.
        
          2. Please see Target Initial Response Times below and contact Google for more
          information. Premium is available for purchase at an additional charge.
        
          B. Customer Efforts to Fix Issues. Prior to making a Request, Customer
          will use reasonable efforts to resolve any error, bug, malfunction or network
          connectivity defect without escalation to Google. After making this initial effort, a
          Customer Contact may submit a written request for technical support services through the
          GES Site or, if authorized, make a request by phone.
        
          C. Characterization of Requests. Customers determine issue Priority
          (please use this chart)
          upon Request submission. Upon receiving a Request from a Customer Contact, Google will
          confirm whether the Request is a "Service Unusable," "Standard Request" or a "Feature
          Request". Any such determination made by Google is final and binding on Customer. Google
          reserves the right to change Customer's priority designation if Google believes that
          Customer's designation is incorrect and will inform Customer of any such change. Customer
          may appeal any such reclassification to Google's technical support service personnel as
          provided in the GES Site.
        
          D. Procedures for Acknowledgement and Request Resolution. When making a
          Request, Customer will provide requested diagnostic information including, but not
          limited to:
        
Customer's product domain name or names, or other Google product identifiers such as
          API keys and Client ID strings;
          
Customer's software version, serial, and/or order numbers, when available;
          
Customerâs machine, network, and/or hardware specifications and configuration, when
          relevant;
          
Description of the issue, including any error messages and
          
Description of Customerâs efforts to resolve the issue (see Section B above) prior to
          contacting Google.
          
          Customer Contact commits to further communication via email or telephone to answer
          questions and assist Google support personnel as needed. If Customer does not provide
          timely communication the Request will be considered resolved.
        
          E. Feature Requests. If Google deems a Request to be a Feature Request,
          Google will log such Request for consideration and will consider the Request resolved.
          Google is under no obligation to respond to or enact any Feature Request or to include
          any such Feature Request in any future update or release.
        
          F. Custom Implementations and Errors in Data. Google reserves the sole
          right to determine whether to respond to Requests regarding: (i) general or custom
          implementations that do not adhere to the documented and supported Product and Service
          configurations; (ii) underlying errors in data; and (iii) cases where user account data
          or address locations are incorrect or missing.
        
          G. Request Acknowledgement. Google may respond to a Request by
          acknowledging the Requestâs receipt. Customer agrees that Google may be unable to provide
          answers to, or resolve, all Requests.
        
          H. Supported Product Version. Unless otherwise specified in writing by
          Google, (i) Google will support the current and one immediately previous official version
          of the Products and Services, and (ii) Google will only support the most recent official
          version of these products for Android and other mobile software. Where applicable,
          Customerâs hardware must meet all system requirements for the Product and Services as
          documented.
        
        3. Accessing Technical Support Services
          A. Support Site. Customer must contact Google via the GES Site, or via
          the phone contact information published in the GES Site, to receive Standard or Premium
          technical support. Customer may use product-specific Help Center forms to receive Basic
          technical support. Requests submitted via personal email, posts to forums, âSend
          Feedbackâ forms, or other channels may not be responded to and are not covered by this
          TSSG.
        
          B. Phone. For products which offer phone support, Customer must be able
          to access the GES Site to retrieve phone contact information and, where applicable,
          Customer PINs.
        
          C. Designated Customer Contacts. Customer Contacts will provide
          first-level support to internal Customer end users. Google will provide second-level
          technical support services to Customer Contacts only. Customer may edit the Customer
          Contact information in the GES Site, where possible. If Customer is not able to use the
          GES Site for this purpose, Customer will notify Google of changes via a Request. All
          Customer Contact changes must be made at least five Business Days before the change
          becomes effective.
        
          D. Support Hours. Google will process Requests during the Hours of
          Operation, unless otherwise indicated here. Any Requests received outside of the Hours of
          Operation will be logged and processed at the beginning of the next Business Day.
        
          E. Target Initial Response Times. Google will make commercially
          reasonable efforts to respond to Requests as determined by Service Level:

        4. General Provisions
          A. Violation of Acceptable Use Policy (AUP). Technical support services
          are not provided to Customers that violate the AUP. Unless otherwise indicated by Google
          in writing, the AUP governing Product and Services use and support is located here.
        
          B. TSSG Updates. Google may update this TSSG from time to time upon
          notice to Customer.
        
          C. Maintenance. If Google expects planned Maintenance to negatively
          affect Product and Services availability or functionality, Google will use commercially
          reasonable efforts to provide advanced notice of the Maintenance. In addition, Google may
          perform emergency unscheduled Maintenance at any time. If Google expects such emergency
          unscheduled Maintenance to negatively affect the technical support services availability
          or functionality, Google will use commercially reasonable efforts to provide advance
          notice of such Maintenance. Maintenance notices will be provided via the GES Site. In
          addition, Customers who subscribe may also be able to receive email and/or RSS Feed
          notifications of Maintenance.
        
          D. Language. The parties agree that all technical support services
          provided by Google to Customer pursuant to this TSSG will be provided in the English
          language.
        
          E. Term of Support. Google will only provide the technical support
          services described in this TSSG during the term of the Agreement and will have no
          obligation to provide any technical support services to Customer after the Agreementâs
          expiration or termination.
        
        5. Basic and Standard Support
