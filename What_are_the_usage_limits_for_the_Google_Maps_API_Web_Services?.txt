  on the 
Google Developers Console.
Usage limits
How is Google Maps APIs Premium Plan usage
  calculated?
Have a previous Maps API for Work or
  Maps API for Business license?
  See our Maps API for Work Licenses
  guide. To determine whether you have a previous license: In the
  Google for Work Support Portal,
  click Maps: Usage Report on the left. If the ID at the top of the report
  is in the following format, you have the new Premium Plan:
  gme-[company] & proj-[number] ([type])
  Otherwise, you have a previous license.
With the Google Maps APIs Premium Plan, your application consumes quota at
    different rates, depending on the APIs it requests. You purchase
    quota—called Maps APIs Credits—for one or more years,
    based on an estimate of your application's annual usage. All of your
    application's requests for Maps APIs consume credits from the pool of
    credits you purchased. For example, if your application uses the
    Google Maps JavaScript API to display a map, it consumes credits for
    the Maps JavaScript API
    map loads. If your
    application consumes all of the credits in the pool, you can purchase
    additional credits as needed. For more information, see the guide to
    Premium Plan
    usage rates and limits.
How can I track my app's Google Maps APIs Premium Plan
  usage?
For information on tracking your application's usage of Maps APIs Credits,
    as well as other usage reports and analytics, see the guide to Premium Plan
    reports.
How can I estimate my application's usage of Maps APIs
  Credits?
You can use the
    Google Maps
    APIs
    Premium Calculator to get an estimate of your application's usage.
In addition, you may find the
    credits calculation example
    useful.
What happens if I use all of my Maps APIs Credits?
If you run out of Maps APIs Credits, your application's requests will
    continue to succeed, but your account may be subject to overage fees. In
    this case, you'll need to renew your Google Maps APIs Premium license as
    soon as possible to avoid a suspension of your account. Google will notify
    you via email once you've used up 85% of your quota.
Why are Google Places API Details requests
  charged 2 Maps APIs Credits while Place
  Autocomplete requests are charged only 0.1 credits?
The Google Places API uses an extensive database of business and other
    place data. It takes a lot of time and effort to keep this database
    accurate, as businesses open and close frequently. Therefore, we need to
    charge more for Places Details requests. For Place Autocomplete, we realize
    that users often need to type several characters to find a place, so we are
    charging only a fractional credit for each request.
Developing your application
Will I be issued both a Google Developers Console project ID
  and a client ID?
Yes, your welcome letter will include your Google Developers Console project ID
  and your client ID. 
Will the Google Developers Console project I'm provided have all
  available APIs enabled?
Yes, with the Premium Plan, we automatically
    provision all of our APIs for the same Google Developers Console project. You can
    access all the APIs in one project. APIs on the same platform (Web, Web
    Services, Android, or iOS) can share the same API key. Your API keys provide
    real-time usage reports and historical usage data for up to 30 days. If you
    need features such as Maps API Analytics, usage reports by channel, and
    historical report data beyond the 30 days, you can use your client ID
    instead of the API key for most of the APIs. (The client ID does not work
    with the Google Places API, Google Maps Geolocation API,
    Google Maps Roads API, Google Maps Android API, or
    Google Maps SDK for iOS.)
What are the differences between an API key and a client ID?
With your project ID, you can generate API keys in
  the Google Developers Console. Here are the
  primary differences between the use of API keys and your client ID:
API support: You can use an API key with any Maps API. Alternatively, you
    can use your client ID with any API, except  the Google Places API,
    Google Maps Geolocation API, Google Maps Roads API, Google Maps Android API, and
    Google Maps SDK for iOS.
Reporting: Your API keys provide
    real-time usage reports and historical usage data for up to 30 days. If you
    need features such as Maps API Analytics, usage reports by channel, and
    historical report data beyond the 30 days, use your client ID for APIs that support
    its use.
Error codes: If you use API keys, you receive error messages according
    to HTTP status code class (for example, 3xx and 4xx errors), which provide only general
    information. If you use your client ID, you receive more detailed API-specific error codes in
    the Google for Work Support Portal reports, which can help
    with troubleshooting.
Security: Both API keys and the client ID are equally secure, as long as
    you follow these guidelines:
    
If you use an API key, make sure you keep your key secret. All requests to Maps APIs use
        HTTPS, so the risks of someone intercepting your traffic are limited. However, if someone
        were to obtain your key, they could make requests for Maps APIs using your key. To prevent
        this risk for client-side APIs, you can restrict the domains that can use your key.
        For server-side APIs, restrict your key so that requests are allowed only from
        your servers' source IP addresses. For more information about using API keys securely,
        see the Console Help Center.
If you use your client ID, make sure you keep your cyptographic key (which you use to
        generate digital signatures) secret. Also make sure you never use the crypto key in your
        API requests or use it to sign URLs using JavaScript, as these practices can expose your
        key.
How do I access Zagat features with the
  Google Maps APIs Premium Plan?
With the Premium Plan, requests containing your
    API key to the Google Places API Web Service return premium Zagat content.
    To verify that you have access to Zagat content, send a request to the
    Google Places API Web Service, with a key from the project created for you
    during signup. Here's an example URL:
https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/place/textsearch/json?query=restaurants+in+mountain+View,+ca&key;=YOUR_API_KEY
How do I access premium mobile features with the
  Google Maps APIs Premium Plan?
You can access premium mobile features using the same SDKs available to
    users of the standard API: the
    Google Maps SDK for iOS and the
    Google Maps Android API.
    To access premium features, make sure you use the API key from the project
    created for you during signup. To verify that you have access to premium
    mobile features, load a map using the static library. For more information,
    see the guides to getting started with the
    Premium Plan
    on Android and
    on iOS.
Is the dynamic library available for Android with the
  Google Maps APIs Premium Plan?
Yes, with the Premium Plan, you can also use the
    dynamic library for the Google Maps Android API instead of the static
    library. For more information, see the guide to getting started with the
    Premium Plan
    on Android.
  How do I access the Google Maps JavaScript API using a
  Google Maps APIs Premium Plan client ID, from a page that's loaded over
  HTTPS (SSL)?
To access the Google Maps JavaScript API from a page that's loaded
    over HTTPS, you must first
    authorize
    the HTTPS URLs on which you wish to use the API.
  
  How do I load the Google Maps JavaScript API over HTTPS (SSL) when using
  the Common Loader base_domain parameter?
It is not possible to load the Maps JavaScript API over SSL using the
    common loader with the base_domain parameter set.
The base_domain parameter does not affect your application's
    performance — API requests are always handled by the optimal Maps
    server for a particular user's location regardless of the domain from which
    the API is loaded.
base_domain does bias geocoding results towards the specified
    region; to achieve the same effect without base_domain,
    set
      the geocoding service's region parameter.
KML
How do I render KML files that are hosted on intranet
  sites on a map?
The 
KmlLayer class that generates KML overlays in the
    Google Maps JavaScript API uses a Google hosted service to retrieve and
    parse KML files for rendering. Consequently it is not possible to display
    KML files that are not hosted at a URL that is available publicly
    accessible, or that require authentication to access.
If you need to develop applications that use KML files hosted on intranet
    sites we recommend that you render the KML on the client side by using
    third-party JavaScript libraries. As the KML file is analyzed by the
    browser, performance may be lower than by using the
    KmlLayer class.
URL signing
Can I sign URLs using JavaScript?
We strongly recommend against signing URLs using JavaScript as this would
    expose your cryptographic key to end users. Therefore signatures should
    only be generated by server side components.
Why am I receiving a HTTP 403 Forbidden response to my
  Maps API web service requests?
An HTTP 403 response indicates a permission issue, likely because the
    signature could not be verified for this request. This could be because:
  
A signature has been specified but is incorrect for this request.
The request specifies a Google Maps APIs Premium Plan client ID but
      does not specify a signature, and the web service being called requires
      that all requests made using a client ID include a valid signature.
A signature has been specified but the associated
      Google Maps APIs Premium Plan client ID has not been specified.
Styling
Why aren't businesses showing up on my map?
When loading a map using the Google Maps JavaScript API and
    including a client parameter, business listings on the map are
    turned off by default. To turn them back on, you'll need to include some
    styling code with your
    map:
var styles = [
  {
    featureType: 'poi.business',
    stylers: [
      { visibility: 'on' }
    ]
  }
];
map.setOptions({styles: styles});
