    the terms that govern your use of the Google Maps APIs.
Usage Limits
How is Google Maps API for Work usage tracked and
  reported?
For Google Maps API for Work licenses that are limited
    to a specific number of page views, a page view is defined as:
A single load of the Google Maps JavaScript API into a page. The
      JavaScript API is reloaded every time a page that uses the API is
      reloaded. User interactions with the map (eg. panning, zooming, changing
      map types) do not generate more page views. Note however that a page view
      is generated if the API is loaded into the page even if the API is not
      then used to display a map. We therefore recommend against including the
      <script> tag that loads the API in page templates, and
      recommend loading the API
      asynchronously on pages where maps are only displayed in response to
      optional user activity.
A single request for a Google Street View Image API or Google Static
      Maps API image.
A single load of the Google Earth API into a page.
Google Maps API for Work customers can track their page view usage on the the
    Google for Work Support Portal at:
    https://www.google.com/enterprise/portal
Note that non-Work applications are limited by map loads,
    which are slightly different than page views. Please refer to the
    Maps API FAQ for more
    information.
The Google Maps Mobile SDK for Work uses map loads to track usage.
    Please refer to the
    Usage Limits
    for more information.
  What are the usage limits for the Google Maps JavaScript API v3?
  What are the usage limits for the Google Earth API?
Requests that constitute page views are
  applied against the total number of page views purchased with your
  Google Maps API for Work license. When this limit is reached, you will
  need to renew your license promptly.
  What are the usage limits for the Google Maps Mobile SDK for Work?
Each map load is applied against the total number of map loads
  purchased with your Google Maps Mobile SDK for Work license. When this
  limit is reached, you will need to renew your license promptly.
What are the usage limits for the Google Maps API Web
  Services?
Google Maps API for Work customers are provided with the following
    usage limits for the Google
      Maps API Web Services:
  
Web Service
Limits
Directions
100 000 requests per 24 hour period
      and a maximum of 23 waypoints per
      request. Rate limit of 10 requests per second.
Elevation
100 000 requests per 24 hour period
      and a maximum of 512 points per
      request. Rate limit of 10 requests per
      second.
Geocoding
100 000 requests per 24 hour period.
      Rate limit of 10 requests per second.
Distance Matrix
100 000 elements per 24 hour
      period, a maximum of 625 elements
      per query and a maximum of 1000
      elements per 10 seconds.
Time Zone
 100 000 requests per 24 hour period. Rate
      limit of 10 requests per second.
Roads API
 100 000 requests per 24 hour period. Rate
      limit of 10 requests per second. Each request
      may contain up to 100 points.
These limits apply to each Google Maps API for Work client ID or developer
    project and are shared across all applications and IP addresses using a given client
    ID or developer project.
If you need higher usage limits, please contact your
    Google Maps API for Work Account Manager for purchase information.
What are the usage limits for the Google Places
  API and the Geolocation API?
If you've purchased the Google Places API or the Geolocation API as part
    of your Google Maps API for Work contract, your limits will be listed
    in the Quotas section of the 
Google Developers Console.
    If you need a higher limit, please
    contact Google through
    the Google for Work Support Portal.
  What are the usage limits for Geocoding requests made from the Maps
  JavaScript API?
Google Maps API for Work customers are provided with the following
    usage limits for Geocoding requests made from the JavaScript API:
Service
API being used
Limits
Geocoding
JavaScript v3
Geocoding has a daily allocation and rate limit which is applied per
          user session, regardless of how many users share a given IP
          address.
This service should not be used for batch geocoding operations; you
          may wish to use the 
            Geocoding API for such operations.
What are the usage limits for the Google Maps
  Image APIs?
Google Maps API for Work customers are provided with the following
    usage limits for the Google Maps Image APIs:
Service
Limits
Static Maps API
Requests are applied against the total number of page views
          purchased with the Google Maps API for Work license.
The maximum image size is 2048 by 2048 pixels. This is calculated as
          size times scale, as explained below.
Street View Image API
Requests are applied against the total number of page views
          purchased with the Google Maps API for Work license.
The maximum image size is 2048 by 2048 pixels.
Static Map API images can be requested up to 2048x2048 pixels. Because the
    scale value in a static map request affects the number of
    pixels returned, the maximum size value is different for
    each scale level:
Scale
Max Size
Returns
1
2048x2048
2048x2048
2
1024x1024
2048x2048
4
512x512
2048x2048
The Street View Image API does not support the scale
    parameter.
Using the Maps API over HTTPS
  How do I access the Google Maps APIs over HTTPS (SSL) using a Google Maps API for Work client ID?
To access the Google Maps APIs over HTTPS, you must first
    authorize
      the HTTPS URLs on which you wish to use the Maps API.
    Once your client ID has been enabled for use on these sites,
    you can substitute http for https when loading
    the JavaScript or passing a URL. For more information, refer to the
    documentation.
  
  How do I load the Google Maps JavaScript API over HTTPS (SSL) when using the
  Common Loader base_domain parameter?
It is not possible to load the Maps JavaScript API over SSL using the
    common loader with the base_domain parameter set.
The base_domain parameter does not affect your application's
    performance — API requests are always handled by the optimal Maps
    server for a particular user's location regardless of the domain from which
    the API is loaded.
base_domain does bias geocoding results towards the specified
    region; to achieve the same effect without base_domain,
    set
      the geocoding service's region parameter.
KML
How do I render KML files that are hosted on intranet
  sites on a map?
The 
KmlLayer class that generates KML overlays in the Google
    Maps API uses a Google hosted service to retrieve and parse KML files for
    rendering. Consequently it is not possible to display KML files that are
    not hosted at a URL that is available publicly accessible, or that require
    authentication to access.
If you need to develop applications that use KML files hosted on intranet
    sites we recommend that you render the KML on the client side by using
    third-party JavaScript libraries. As the KML file is analyzed by the
    browser, performance may be lower than by using the
    KmlLayer class.
URL Signing
Can I sign URLs using JavaScript?
We strongly recommend against signing URLs using JavaScript as this would
    expose your cryptographic key to end users. Therefore signatures should
    only be generated by server side components.
Why am I receiving a HTTP 403 Forbidden response to my
  Maps API web service requests?
An HTTP 403 response indicates a permission issue, likely because the
    signature could not be verified for this request. This could be because:
  
A signature has been specified but is incorrect for this request.
The request specifies a Google Maps API for Work client id but
      does not specify a signature, and the web service being called requires that all
      requests made using a client id include a valid signature.
A signature has been specified but the associated Google Maps API for Work
      client ID has not been specified.
Styling
Why aren't businesses showing up on my map?
When loading a Google Map using the v3 API and including a
    client parameter, business listings on the map are turned off
    by default. To turn them back on, you'll need to include some
    styling code with your
    map:
var styles = [
  {
    featureType: 'poi.business',
    stylers: [
      { visibility: 'on' }
    ]
  }
];
map.setOptions({styles: styles});
